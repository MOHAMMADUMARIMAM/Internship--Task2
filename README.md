# Internship--Task2
Exploratory Data Analysis on Titanic dataset using Python
# 🚢 Titanic EDA - Exploratory Data Analysis

This project is part of my AI & ML internship. It explores the Titanic dataset using Python, Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib.

## 📌 What I Did

- Loaded and understood the dataset
- Checked missing values and data types
- Performed Univariate and Bivariate Analysis
- Created various visualizations:
  - Histograms, Boxplots
  - Countplots for Survival, Class, Gender
  - Correlation heatmap

## 🔍 Key Insights

- Females had higher survival rate than males
- 1st Class passengers had better survival chances
- Many missing values in Age and Cabin
- Fare has outliers, especially in 1st class

## 🛠 Libraries Used

- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- NumPy

## 📂 Dataset Used

- Titanic Dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/titanic-dataset)

## 📎 File Structure
